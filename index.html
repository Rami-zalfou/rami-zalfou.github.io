            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p><strong>The Historical State and Economic Development: Evidence from Ottoman Syria’s Nomadic Frontier</strong></p>
            <p>Abstract: This paper investigates the long-term impacts of statelessness in Ottoman Syria, focusing on the regions demarcated by the 'desert line' - a boundary that separated areas under Ottoman state control from those subject to tribal raids until the middle of the 19th century. Using geocoded census data alongside historical data on Ottoman state control in the 19th century, I estimate the effect of historical statelessness on economic outcomes using a spatial regression discontinuity design. The results indicate that a history of statelessness is associated with lower incomes in the present, less developed infrastructure, a higher share of workers in the primary sector, as well as lower levels of human capital. The effect is partly driven by higher population density and urbanization rates in areas of historical state control. The effect is not driven by ethnic or religious differences and is robust to geographic controls.</p>
