            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>I am a doctoral student in Economic history at Lund University and a researcher at the Centre for Advanced Middle Eastern Studies and at the Centre for Economic Demography at Lund University. My research interests include the economic history of the Middle East, economic development, and the economics of immigrant integration.</p>

            <p><strong>The Historical State and Path Dependence: Evidence from Ottoman Syria’s Stateless Frontier</strong></p>
            <p>Abstract: This paper investigates the long-term impacts of statelessness in Ottoman Syria, focusing on the regions demarcated by the 'desert line' - a boundary that separated areas under Ottoman state control from those subject to tribal raids until the middle of the 19th century. Using geocoded census data alongside historical data on Ottoman state control in the 19th century, I estimate the effect of historical statelessness on economic outcomes using a spatial regression discontinuity design. The results indicate that a history of statelessness is associated with lower incomes in the present, less developed infrastructure, a higher share of workers in the primary sector, as well as lower levels of human capital. The effect is partly driven by higher population density and urbanization rates in areas of historical state control. The effect is not driven by ethnic or religious differences and is robust to geographic controls.</p>

            <p><strong>Ethnic and Religious Differences in Female Labor Force Participation: Evidence from Syrian Census Data.</strong></p>
            <p>Abstract: This paper investigates the extent and causes of differences in Female Labor Force Participation (FLFP) across ethnic and religious groups in Syria. Using census data and the Gelbach decomposition method, the paper reveals substantial gaps in FLFP across groups, with differences reaching up to 18 percentage points. To understand the factors underlying these gaps, the analysis exploits the heterogeneity in economic development, demographic profiles, and educational attainment across towns and villages. The study finds that the main correlates of gaps in FLFP are the age distribution of the population, income, education, and the public sector employment share. The contribution of social norms is examined through the use of gender parity indices for educational enrolment and attainment to proxy for social restrictions on women but are not found to contribute significantly to ethnic and religious gaps in FLFP.</p>

            <p><strong>Premium or Penalty? Occupations and Earnings of Ottoman Immigrants and their Offspring in the United States, 1900–1940. (with Martin Dribe)</strong></p>
            <p>Abstract: We study the economic integration of immigrants from Ottoman Syria and Turkey and their offspring in the United States using full count census data for the period 1900 to 1940. Using occupational scores, we find significant premiums for men on arrival in the US, but significant penalties when using actual earnings data collected in 1940. These penalties grow with time since arrival, suggesting low levels of assimilation. However, the second generation closes most of the gap to native Whites. This contrasts with the experience of Northern European immigrants who matched natives more closely in terms of occupations and earnings.</p>
